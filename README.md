## üî¨ Research Experience
**Doctoral candidate @<a href="https://tnau.ac.in/" target="_blank">CEREMA - IFSTTAR, Nantes (FRANCE)</a> (_2016 - 2019_)**
- **Thesis title**: _Monitoring subsurface conditions of pavement structures using Ultra-wideband radar technology_
- **Problem statement**: Early detection of small defects (debondings) in pavement structures is crucial for preventing further damage and ensuring long-term durability.
- **Challenges faced**: Traditional Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) lacks the resolution to detect small defects. The lack of adaptable signal processing and feature engineering methods to automate defect detection using non-destructive techniques motivated this research work.
- **Solutions proposed**: Use of Ultra-Wideband Radar (UWB) and artificial intelligence methods to detect and characterize millimeter-scale defects in civil engineering structures.
- **Methodologies**: Both theoretical and experimental approaches, including testing on real pavement slabs, were employed.
Non-destructive evaluation and monitoring of infrastructures for early detection of structural damage
Development and optimization of artificial intelligence methods (based on supervised machine learning)
Generation of mathematical and numerical synthetic 2D and 3D models for validation of AI detection models
- **Results obtained**: Demonstrated the feasibility of early defect detection using the proposed approach using machine learning methods along with suitable feature engineering and signal processing techniques.
